              <h2> Leadership </h2>
              <p class="description"> As a music educator, my goals are to remain focused and purposeful throughout every aspect of my teaching. I strive to have a dedication to showing compassion, while encouraging a safe and joyful music making experience for everyone involved. A successful leader must have an open mind and be willing to consider the perspectives of those they lead in order to create a space where ideas and growth are encouraged. I continuously aspire to be able to empower my students and teach them not only how to be amazing musicians, but also strong and loving people inside and outside of the classroom. I plan to continue seeking leadership opportunities both within the JMU School of Music and within my extracurricular activities. Throughout my time at JMU, I have already grown with my leadership abilities and mindset towards what it means to be a truly dedicated and passionate leader, and will continue to do so as I go through my experience as a student and music educator. </p>

              <h3> Teaching Without Talking </h3>
              <p> This teaching activity is meant to showcase different forms of communication music educators can use other than talking. Meredith Scarboro (a fellow music education student at JMU) and I decided to teach solfege without talking for this activity. We used images on a slideshow, hand signs, directive motions, and demonstrations. In the lesson plan we decided to teach solfege syllables and their respective hand signs. We then built off of that by singing rounds and harmonies using solfege, and ending with sightreading through a popular nursery rhythm, "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."</p>
