              <h2> Musicianship </h2>
              <p class="description"> The development of a great musical mind does not only involve the skills we have as musicians, but also the way we think and feel the music. As a musician, I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to grow within my craft, but also seeking ways to bring joy to myself and to others in the process. I'm currently a member of JMU's A Cappella group Into Hymn. Making music with the members in this group not only challenges my growth in categories like aural skills and teamwork, but it also allows me to gain performance experience. In regards to my experience within JMU's School of Music, my time in University's Women's Choir and Treble Chamber Choir has also challenged my growth as a musician. These ensembles have helped me grow my understanding and skills with interpreting and understanding music, specifically with choral music. My time within my JMU School of Music studio has also played a huge role in my ongoing development and growth as a musician. Within my studio we are constantly encouraged to perform for our peers and to give and receive both positive and critical feedback, while always maintaining an incredibly supportive and welcoming environment. Through all of these experiences, I hope to continue developing more technical skills, but also learn more ways in which to highlight the importance of the musicianship described above when I myself am a music educator. A musicianship that exudes passion and a sense of belonging. </p>

          <h3> MUS 150: Image Based Composition </h3>
          <p> The goal of this assignment was to create a piece of music (60 sec or longer) that complimented an image or group of images of our choosing. I chose to use Soundtrap, a Spotify affiliated site in which anyone can create an account. The link to make an account on Soundtrap is https://www.soundtrap.com <br>
          I chose to display two images (the first taken by Paul Thompson and the second taken by Mario Tamagotchi's, both from Getty Images). Originally I wanted to display many pictures in the form of a slideshow, however I feel that the two photos side by side speaks louder. The first photo is from the Women's Suffrage Movement and a more recent image from the Women's March at DC in 2017. Both images, while being years apart, are both incredibly similar. I wanted to include not only the women that fought for our rights before my time but also to end with the fight for full equality that’s still going on today. In my composition, I added an exert of an audio recording of Sylvia Plath reading her very own poem, “Lady Lazarus,” of which I feel speaks strongly on the topic. I started with a melody that’s slower but has an uplifting quality to it. I then added a beat that comes in shortly after that, I feel, really progresses the melody forward, just as these women that came before me did for my rights today. I then end with a loop of that same melody, but on trumpets to provide a sense of hope and message of “we aren’t finished fighting yet."</p>
