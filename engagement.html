              <h2> Engagement </h2>
              <p class="description"> Engagement is such an important aspect to music education that can make or break a student's learning experience. Engagement should involve an encouraging, welcoming, and fruitful learning experience for all parties involved. As educators, it's our job to engage and teach our students, however it's important to recognize that educators should also be learning and growing themselves through these experiences. There is a constant need for development and growth as musicians that we can always receive through our engagement with others. I believe I have a calling to love unconditionally and to serve others, this of course extends to my view on music education where my goal is to provide a safe and welcoming environment to all of my students. Everybody deserves to feel valued and heard in their musical perspectives, regardless of their personal experiences. Within my music program, I hope to not only build a community between individual ensemble members, but also integrate each ensemble and grade level in order to create a community of encouragement and support that extends throughout the entirety of my program.  </p>

              <h3> MUS 252: Podcast Analysis Project </h3>
              <p> In MUS 254 (Form and Analysis: Popular Music) during the fall 2021 semester, I chose to create a podcast with fellow classmates Cara Ainge and Dejuan Woods Jr. for the final project. In this assignment we analyzed the song All Too Well (10 Minute Version)(From the Vault)(Taylors's Version) by Taylor Swift. The goal of this assignment was to pick any popular music song and analyze any of the elements that had been discussed in class throughout the semester. We chose to  analyze multiple elements discussed in class including lyrics, form, and intertextuality. This assignment was incredibly fulfilling and fruitful experience, allowing me to grow in my theory skills and knowledge. It was also an amazing way to engage with fellow music majors while diving into the music of a song we all enjoy! </p>

            <h3> MUS 150: Podcast Interview </h3>
            <p> I interviewed a fellow student at JMU about her musical experience and relationship with music. It was inspiring to hear her outlook on music and how it personally has had and continues to have an effect on her life. <br>
            We covered topics like: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What music she listens to </li>
          <li>Earliest musical memories </li>
          <li>What instruments she plays </li>
          <li>Musical experience and classes</li>
          <li>Her personal musical goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the interview, I felt pretty inspired by my fellow student. She has big dreams and big plans and I learned to never doubt my own personal dreams. This interview inspired me to always reflect upon where I'm at and where I want to be moving forward. </p>
